> [django-for-runners_ynh](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/django-for-runners_ynh) allows you to install Django-ForRunners quickly and simply on a YunoHost server. If you don't have YunoHost, please consult [the guide](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to learn how to install it.

## Features:


* GPX track management:
  * Upload GPX tracks
  * Import GPX tracks from commandline
  * Track analysis:
    * basics: Track length / Duration / Pace / Hart rate Up-/Downhill
    * Display route on OpenStreetMap map
    * Graphs with elevation / heart rate / cadence (if available in GPX data)
  * Data that is automatically extracted from the web:
    * Start/finish Address from OpenStreetMap
    * Start/finish weather information from metaweather.com
  * Store additional data:
    * Ideal track distance (for easier grouping/filtering tracks)
* sports competitions Management:
  * Create a List of Sport Events
    * Add participation to a event
    * link GPX track with a event participation
    * Store you event participation:
      * official track length
      * measured finisher time
      * Number of participants who have finished in your discipline
    * Add links to webpages relatet to this event
    * Record costs (entry fee, T-shirt etc.)
* common
  * Multiple user support (However: no rights management and currently only suitable for a handful of users)


## Developer information

### prepare

To start hacking: Just clone the project and start `./manage.py` to bootstrap a virtual environment:

```bash
# Install base requirements for bootstraping:
~$ sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv

# Get the sources:
~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners.git
~$ cd django-for-runners/

# Just call manage.py:
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py --help
...
[manage_django_project]
    code_style
    coverage
    install
    project_info
    publish
    run_dev_server
    safety
    tox
    update_req
...
```
This bootstrap is realized with: https://github.com/jedie/manage_django_project



Start Django's dev server:
```bash
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py run_dev_server
````
The web page is available in Port 8000, e.g.: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`


Run tests, e.g.:
```bash
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py test
# or with coverage
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py coverage
# or via tox:
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py tox
````



### import GPX files

e.g.:
```
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py import_gpx --username <django_username> ~/backups/gpx_files
```

**Note:** It is no problem to start **import_gpx** with the same GPX files: Duplicate entries are avoided. The start/finish (time/latitude/longitude) are compared.

### backup

Create a backup into `.../backups/<timestamp>/` e.g.:
```
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.py backup
```

The backup does:


* backup the database
* export all GPX tracks
* generate .csv files:
* a complete file with all running tracks
* one file for every user

## some notes

### GPX storage

Currently we store the unchanged GPX data in a TextField.

### static files

We collect some JavaScript files, for easier startup. These files are:

| Project Homepage                      | License                                                                                   | storage directory                                                                                                   |

### Precision of coordinates

GPX files from Garmin (can) contain:


* latitude with 29 decimal places
* longitude with 28 decimal places
* elevation with 19 decimal places

The route on OpenStreetMap does not look more detailed, with more than 5 decimal places.

## Backwards-incompatible changes


### v0.16.0

We switched from Poetry to pip-tools and https://github.com/jedie/manage_django_project
Just remove the old Poetry venv and bootstrap by call the `./manage.py`, see above.

We also remove different Django Versions from test matrix and just use the current newest version.
Because this is a project and not really a reuse-able-app ;)
