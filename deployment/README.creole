=  Django-ForRunners - deployment instruction

Web based management to catalog things including state and location etc. using Python/Django.

**Note:**

* This README contains only the instruction to install  Django-ForRunners on a root server.
* Read [[https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners/tree/master#readme|the main README]] for local development installation.

Pull requests welcome!


== Project structure

There are two main directories:

|= directory |= description
| **[[https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners/tree/master/src|/src/]]**               | The main  Django-ForRunners source code
| **[[https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners/tree/master/deployment|/deployment/]]** | deploy  Django-ForRunners for production use case


== deploy

Install  Django-ForRunners on a root server:

**Note:**

* Running a public web server is a lot of work and brings some risks.
* This instructions are only the basics to get  Django-ForRunners working.
* To run the server safely, more work should be done, which is not explained here.
* Run at your own risk! No warranty is given.


=== prepare root server

Here some steps for a fresh created root server:

Update all packages, e.g.:
{{{
apt update && apt -y full-upgrade
}}}

Setup a normal user. You may use [[https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners/blob/deployment/scripts/setup_user.sh|scripts/setup_user.sh]]


===  Setup SSH services

{{{
~# nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
}}}

Change e.g.:
{{{
Port xxxx
PermitRootLogin no
PasswordAuthentication no
}}}
(Changing the Port may need to change a firewall/network settings)

{{{
# restart SSH deamon:
~# service ssh restart

# Display and follow the ssh log output to see connection errors:
~# journalctl -f -u ssh
}}}

* Keep the current SSH session (with the log output) open!
* Update your {{{~/.ssh/config}}}
* Try to connect as the new, normal user in a **separate** terminal

Only after a working new connection: Terminate the first root SSH session ;)


=== setup unattended-upgrades

{{{
~$ sudo apt install unattended-upgrades
~$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
~$ sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades
}}}


=== install requirements

Install docker, see: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

install some base packages, e.g.:
{{{
~$ sudo apt install git make
}}}



=== install  Django-ForRunners

{{{
# Checkout the deployment branch:
~$ git clone https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners.git
~$ cd  Django-ForRunners/deployment/

# Theses Makefile targets exists:
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make

 Django-ForRunners - *deployment* Makefile

install-poetry       install or update poetry
install              install requirements to setup project
update               update the sources and docker containers
up                   Start containers via docker-compose
down                 Stop all containers

reload_for_runners     Reload server in "for_runners" container
}}}

Install, e.g.:

{{{
# install or update poetry:
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make install-poetry
}}}

To keep poetry running (PATH must be expand) just logout and login ;)

{{{
# install requirements (e.g.: docker-compose) via poetry:
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make install
}}}

Create a {{{.env}}} file in project root directory with these content, e.g.:
{{{
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ touch .env
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ nano .env
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ cat .env
# Your Public domain:
HOSTNAME=domain.tld

# eMail address for Let's encrypt:
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=webmaster@domain.tld
}}}

For local testing of the docker-compose setup, used this values:
{{{
HOSTNAME=localhost
LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=internal
}}}
(Caddy will create a self signed https certificate)

Start containers via docker-compose:
{{{
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make up
}}}

Notes: At the first start it takes a little while until the database is created ;)

Create first super user:
{{{
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make docker_createsuperuser
}}}

* Now you should be able to connect to your  Django-ForRunners installation and login with created super user.
* Redirect from **http** to **https** should work.
* Let's Encrypt certificate should be installed and valid.
* Containers should be restarted after a server reboot


=== Maintenance

TO keep everything up-to-date do the following steps:

Update the OS call:
{{{
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ sudo ./scripts/apt-distupgrade.sh
}}}

Update  Django-ForRunners installation and docker containers:
{{{
~/ Django-ForRunners/deployment$ make update
}}}

This will do:

* update the source code
* update docker-compose and all requirements
* Pull and rebuild all docker containers
* restart all docker containers

Take a look at [[https://github.com/jedie/ Django-ForRunners/blob/deployment/scripts/apt-cleanup.sh|scripts/apt-cleanup.sh]] to keep your system clean.
